# About Me
I'm senior student at doctorial studies in Russia's University and i'm specialising in economics and national economy management.  I learn quickly and am very flexible in new and unforeseen situations. I perceive problems that arise as challenges. I am a communicative person, eager to interact with others, learn new working methods, and improve the operations of organizations I am part of. I have a strong desire for professional success and am highly motivated by the successful operations of the organization I work for, because of that i wanted to try with programming with RSSchool.
In addition to my academic activities, I am active outside of them as well. I love reading books, both related to my studies and classics and novels. I believe that harmony between learning and free time is essential. I love to travel and learn about the lifestyles of other countries. I believe that willpower is the driving force behind things, and I possess it in abundance.
